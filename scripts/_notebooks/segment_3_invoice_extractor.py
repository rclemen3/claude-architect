# Segment 3: Structured Output, Context, and Production Reliability

**Duration:** 50 minutes
**Maps to:** CCA-F Domain 4 (Prompts + Structured Output, 20%) + Domain 5 (Context + Reliability, 15%)
**References:** [`../docs/domain-4-prompts.md`](../docs/domain-4-prompts.md), [`../docs/domain-5-context.md`](../docs/domain-5-context.md)

Segment 1 built the agent, Segment 2 wired its hands, and Segment 3 makes the **outputs trustworthy**. We'll extract typed `Invoice` objects from messy text with the **forced-tool-call pattern**, then close on the context and escalation levers that keep long sessions honest.
"""

_lo_md = """\
## Learning objectives

- Write **precise prompts** that specify format, edge cases, and missing-data behavior up front
- Use the **forced-tool-call pattern** to enforce a Pydantic-derived JSON schema behind a max-retry ceiling
- Pin **few-shot examples** to lock corner-case behavior that prose can't describe
- Attach a **confidence score** and route low-confidence rows to human review
- Preserve **case facts** with `cache_control` and **prune verbose tool outputs**
- Separate **explicit human requests** from **sentiment signals** when deciding to escalate
"""

_concept_precise_prompts_md = """\
## Precise prompts beat clever prompts

"Be accurate" is a wish, not a prompt. Specify four things up front:

- **Format** - JSON, table, or prose. Pick one, say so.
- **Edge cases** - the output shape on empty or malformed input.
- **Missing data** - `null`, omitted, or a sentinel when the source is silent.
- **Ambiguity** - which reading wins when the input supports two.

**Two or three worked examples** pin behavior more reliably than any temperature change.
"""

_concept_forced_tool_md = """\
## The forced-tool-call pattern for structured output

The canonical pattern for "return data in *this exact shape*":

1. Define a **Pydantic model**.
2. Convert it to **JSON Schema** with `Model.model_json_schema()`.
3. Register that as a **tool's `input_schema`**.
4. Force the call with **`tool_choice={"type": "tool", "name": "<your_tool>"}`**.
5. **Validate** the tool input. On `ValidationError`, append the error back and retry.
6. Enforce a **hard retry ceiling**, or a bad source burns 20 calls.

The schema does the typing, the forced `tool_choice` does the shape, and the retry loop closes the gap.
"""

_concept_context_md = """\
## Case facts and tool-output pruning

Long sessions rot three ways, and each has a counter:

| Failure | Counter |
|---|---|
| **Case facts drift** as turns pile up | **Pin them** in the system prompt. The model attends hardest to the window's top and bottom. |
| **Tool outputs bloat** - 8KB in, three fields read | **Prune** before appending. |
| **Resolved sub-issues clutter** later turns | **Summarize** them. Keep only the active issue verbatim. |

**Compaction** is the fallback for when window pressure hits anyway, not the strategy.
"""

_concept_escalation_md = """\
## Escalation triage (the four real triggers)

Escalate to a human on exactly four triggers:

| Trigger | Example |
|---|---|
| **Policy** | Refund above the agent cap |
| **Complexity** | Multi-system failure, no single owner |
| **Risk** | Security incident, compliance flag |
| **Explicit request** | "I want a human NOW" |

**Don't escalate on sentiment.** "I'm frustrated" is venting, "I want a human" is routing. When you do escalate, hand over a **structured summary** rather than the raw transcript: who, what, what's been tried, what's blocked.

## Demo: invoice extractor with retry

Three invoices, in order of nastiness:

2. **Missing field** - no PO number, `Optional[str]` handles it, no retry.
3. **Ambiguous** - first pass fails, the error goes back, the retry succeeds.

The retry ceiling is **1**, because a truly bad document should fail loudly instead of burning $20 in silence.

## Pinning case facts with `cache_control` (Domain 5)

A long extraction session re-reads the same vendor rules, currency rules, and "don't invent values" prompt on every call. Those are billed tokens you're spending twice.

**`cache_control` on the system block** means "cache everything up to here," so the next call within the cache lifetime reads from cache instead of re-billing. Same lever as Segment 2's tool caching, moved to the **system prompt**.

Two extractions, back-to-back, against a 2KB vendor policy. Watch **`cache_creation_input_tokens`** on call 1, **`cache_read_input_tokens`** on call 2.
"""

_case_facts_code = """\
# Realistic vendor-policy block. Production extractors carry several kilobytes
# of policy: numbering rules, locale conventions, edge-case overrides,
# disambiguation tables. We model that here so the cacheable prefix clears
# Sonnet 4.x's 1024-token floor with margin and the cache demonstrably engages.
VENDOR_POLICY = (
    "VENDOR POLICY (apply to every invoice extraction, in order)\\n\\n"
    "1. Decimal separators. European vendors (Eurozone, UK, Scandinavia, "
    "Eastern Europe) use comma as the decimal separator and period as the "
    "thousands separator: '1.515,00 EUR' is 1515.00 EUR. North American and "
    "most APAC vendors invert: '1,515.00 USD' is 1515.00 USD. When the locale "
    "is ambiguous, prefer the convention that produces a plausible total given "
    "the line items: a $51,500 toner cartridge is almost certainly 51.50.\\n"
    "2. Date formats. DD/MM/YYYY for EU vendors, MM/DD/YYYY for US vendors, "
    "YYYY-MM-DD for ISO-disciplined vendors (most enterprise SaaS). When the "
    "month component is 13+ you know it is DD/MM. When the date is unambiguous "
    "(e.g., 2026-05-20 vs 20/05/2026 vs 05/20/2026), always emit the ISO 8601 "
    "form in your output regardless of the source format.\\n"
    "3. PO numbers. Only fill po_number if the invoice prints one explicitly. "
    "Do not infer from the customer's order history, prior invoices, or "
    "email subject lines. A missing PO is a legitimate state for one-off "
    "purchases (consultants, ad-hoc shipping, expense reimbursements).\\n"
    "4. Totals. Always the final 'TOTAL DUE' line, never a subtotal, never a "
    "'GRAND TOTAL' that double-counts tax. If multiple totals appear, prefer "
    "the one explicitly labeled DUE or PAYABLE. If only a subtotal and a tax "
    "line are visible, sum them and lower confidence by 0.10.\\n"
    "5. Tax handling. Sales tax (US), VAT (EU/UK), GST (Canada/Australia), and "
    "HST (some Canadian provinces) are all separate line items in the source "
    "but roll up into the total. Do not surface tax as a distinct field; the "
    "total field is the bottom line the customer pays. The vendor's tax-ID "
    "number (VAT-ID, GSTIN, EIN) goes in metadata.tax_id if visible.\\n"
    "6. Notes field. Include only the literal memo text printed on the "
    "invoice. Do not paraphrase. Do not summarize. If the invoice has no "
    "memo, the notes field stays empty - not null, not 'N/A', not 'no memo'.\\n"
    "7. Currency. Store the numeric amount in the `total` field. Mention the "
    "currency in the `notes` field whenever it is not USD. ISO 4217 codes "
    "only (EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, MXN, BRL, INR), never symbols, never spelled-"
    "out names. If the invoice mixes currencies (line items in EUR but total "
    "in USD), trust the bottom line and note the conversion in notes.\\n"
    "8. Vendor name normalization. Use the legal entity name as printed, in "
    "upper case if that is how the invoice prints it. Strip company-type "
    "suffixes (GMBH, S.A., LLC, INC) from the searchable name field but "
    "preserve them in the vendor.legal_name field. Strip trailing punctuation.\\n"
    "9. Line-item arrays. Preserve the order from the invoice. Each line item "
    "carries description, quantity, unit_price, and line_total. If any of the "
    "four is missing from the source, set the missing field to null and lower "
    "confidence proportionally. Never invent unit prices by dividing line "
    "totals; quantities can be fractional (consultant hours, freight weight).\\n"
    "10. Confidence scoring. Start at 1.0. Subtract 0.10 for each ambiguity "
    "you resolved against the rules above (decimal-comma resolution, date-"
    "format resolution, total disambiguation, currency conversion). Subtract "
    "0.20 if the source text is OCR output with visible artifacts. Floor at "
    "0.30; if you would go lower, return a structured error instead and let "
    "the retry loop downstream re-prompt with a more specific schema.\\n"
    "11. Edge cases. Credit memos (negative totals) are valid; preserve the "
    "sign. Refund invoices may show a negative due amount; the field name in "
    "the output stays `total` and the value goes negative. Recurring-billing "
    "invoices repeat the same fields each cycle; do not deduplicate across "
    "calls. Drafts and proformas are not yet payable; flag them in notes.\\n"
    "12. Disambiguation table for ambiguous vendor strings (handle in order):\\n"
    "    - 'AMAZON' alone: Amazon Marketplace, currency USD unless suffix \\n"
    "       implies otherwise (AMAZON UK -> GBP, AMAZON DE -> EUR).\\n"
    "    - 'GOOGLE' alone: prefer Google Cloud (workspace + GCP); if line \\n"
    "       items include 'AdWords' or 'Ads', it is Google Ads instead.\\n"
    "    - 'MICROSOFT' alone: prefer Microsoft 365 (subscription pattern); \\n"
    "       Azure invoices print 'Microsoft Azure' explicitly.\\n"
    "    - Bare three-letter acronyms (IBM, SAP, HPE): legal-name field stays \\n"
    "       acronym-form; the metadata.full_name field uses the spelled-out \\n"
    "       form from the invoice header.\\n"
    "13. Locale-specific quirks. German invoices use the Umsatzsteuer-ID \\n"
    "    (USt-IdNr.) for VAT; UK invoices use a 9-digit VAT number; French \\n"
    "    invoices print a SIRET as well as a VAT-ID. Capture whichever \\n"
    "    appears in metadata.tax_id; if multiple appear, prefer VAT-ID.\\n"
    "\\n"
    "DO NOT INVENT VALUES. Optional fields with no source evidence stay null. "
    "Required fields with no source evidence trigger a structured retry, not a "
    "hallucinated guess. Confidence below 0.50 also triggers retry. The audit "
    "log captures every invented value and the cohort gets a weekly report on "
    "extraction quality keyed off that log; do not contribute to it."

## Exercise: triage scorecard (5 minutes)

Name the **design fix** for each failure in one sentence. One fix each, no essays.

| b | Refund of $847 processed against a $500 policy cap | ? |
| c | Synthesis output carries no source attributions | ? |
| d | Agent escalated because the user said "I'm frustrated" | ? |

Answers:

- **(a)** Tighter **tool descriptions**, per-agent scoping, `tool_choice` to force the call.
- **(b)** A **PreToolUse hook**. Policy is code, not a prompt instruction.
- **(c)** **Structured claim-source mappings** from subagents, preserved through synthesis.
- **(d)** Escalate on **policy, complexity, risk, or explicit request** only.

_key_takeaways_md = """\
## Key takeaways

- **Forced tool call + Pydantic schema + retry ceiling** is the canonical structured-output pattern.
- **Few-shot examples** lock corner cases prose can't reach.
- **A `confidence` field** routes the bottom slice to human review. Uncalibrated, still useful.
- **`cache_control` on the system block** pins case facts cheaply. Pruning and compaction are the fallbacks.
- **Escalate on policy, complexity, risk, or explicit request.** Sentiment isn't a signal.

## Going further

Everything below is optional. Pick the group that matches what you want to get better at.

**Deeper on this segment**

- [`../docs/domain-4-prompts.md`](../docs/domain-4-prompts.md) - the full Domain 4 reference on precise prompts, format control, and few-shot design.
- [`../docs/domain-5-context.md`](../docs/domain-5-context.md) - the Domain 5 reference on context windows, caching, pruning, and compaction.

**Structured output, more ways**

- [`../claude-cookbooks-main/tool_use/extracting_structured_json.ipynb`](../claude-cookbooks-main/tool_use/extracting_structured_json.ipynb) - Anthropic's own take on the forced-tool-call extraction pattern.
- [`../claude-cookbooks-main/tool_use/tool_use_with_pydantic.ipynb`](../claude-cookbooks-main/tool_use/tool_use_with_pydantic.ipynb) - Pydantic as the schema authority, which is exactly what we did here.
- [`00-prerequisites/005_controlling_output.ipynb`](00-prerequisites/005_controlling_output.ipynb) - output-shape control at the raw Messages API level, without tools in the way.
- [`00-prerequisites/002_system_prompt.ipynb`](00-prerequisites/002_system_prompt.ipynb) - the system prompt treated as a control surface rather than a greeting.

**Context management**

- [`./segment-2-5-control-surfaces.ipynb`](./segment-2-5-control-surfaces.ipynb) - the self-study deep dive, including the Claude Console `memory_stores` and `vaults` assets that carry the Domain 5 persistence story.
- [`../claude-cookbooks-main/misc/prompt_caching.ipynb`](../claude-cookbooks-main/misc/prompt_caching.ipynb) - caching beyond the single system block we cached above.
- [`../claude-cookbooks-main/tool_use/automatic-context-compaction.ipynb`](../claude-cookbooks-main/tool_use/automatic-context-compaction.ipynb) - the compaction fallback. It doesn't currently run because of an upstream SDK drift bug, so read it for the pattern rather than executing it.

**The managed-agents counterpart**

- [`06-managed-agents/04_structured_output_and_validation.ipynb`](06-managed-agents/04_structured_output_and_validation.ipynb) - the same structured-output problem, solved inside a managed agent.
- [`06-managed-agents/05_context_and_escalation.ipynb`](06-managed-agents/05_context_and_escalation.ipynb) - context management and escalation triage on the managed-agents surface.

**Where to go next**

- [`../docs/EXAM-STUDY-PATH.md`](../docs/EXAM-STUDY-PATH.md) - the domain-by-domain study map.
- [`../docs/COOKBOOK-INDEX.md`](../docs/COOKBOOK-INDEX.md) - which cookbook backs which course topic.
