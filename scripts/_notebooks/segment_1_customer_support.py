# Segment 1: Building AI Agents That Use Tools

**Duration:** 50 minutes
**Maps to:** CCA-F Domain 1 (Agentic Architecture, 27% exam weight)
**Reference:** [`../docs/domain-1-agentic.md`](../docs/domain-1-agentic.md)

We're building a **customer support agent** that decides which tools to call and when to escalate. The model will *want* to break a refund policy, and a **PreToolUse hook** says no. **The guarantee comes from your code, not from begging the prompt.**

**Arc:** first call -> the agentic loop -> Scenario A -> the hook as a **backstop** -> Scenario B.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this segment you will be able to:

- Make a **basic Claude API call** and branch on `stop_reason`
- Explain the **agentic loop** and which `stop_reason` drives each branch
- Place **hooks** at the right lifecycle events (**PreToolUse**, **PostToolUse**)
- Distinguish **prompt-layer guidance** from **application-layer enforcement**
- Recognize **session resume vs fork**, and build a **coordinator-subagent** topology when subtask isolation pays off

_subagent_debrief_md = """\
## What that printout proved

- The coordinator's `messages` array stays small: user request, delegations, subagent **final answers**, synthesis turn.
- Each subagent kept its `tool_use` churn inside its own array. The closing assertion is the proof of **zero leakage**.
- The coordinator stays cheap and legible; the subagents do the heavy lifting with **scoped tools**.

**Production note:** the Claude **Agent SDK** wraps this exact pattern as `Task(subagent=..., prompt=...)`. See `../claude-cookbooks-main/claude_agent_sdk/01_The_chief_of_staff_agent.ipynb`.
"""

_exercise_md = """\
## Exercise (5 minutes)

In chat or on paper, sketch an agent that triages **flaky CI failures**. Name:

1. The **coordinator** and its one-line job
2. **Three subagents**, each with a one-line job and a **tool scope**
3. **One hook**: the event it fires on, and the guarantee it enforces

Two sentences max per agent. Tim will pull one or two to discuss.
"""

_key_takeaways_md = """\
## Key takeaways

- The agentic loop is a **`stop_reason` state machine**. Branch on the enum, never on the prose.
- **Hooks are the deterministic layer.** A guarantee that must hold lives in code, not in a prompt. The hook is the **backstop**, not the centerpiece.
- **Structured errors** (`errorCategory`, `isRetryable`) let the model retry, reformulate, or escalate. Bare strings force it to guess.
- **Session resume vs fork** is Domain 1 vocabulary. The bare API doesn't give it to you; the Agent SDK does.
- **Coordinator-subagent** buys **context isolation** and per-agent tool scope, not cleverness.

## Going further

Everything below is optional and self-paced. Pick the group that matches where you are.

### New to the Messages API?

Work these in order. They cover the primitive this whole segment is built on, one idea per notebook.

- [`00-prerequisites/001_requests.ipynb`](00-prerequisites/001_requests.ipynb) - the bare request, no SDK sugar, so you see the wire format.
- [`00-prerequisites/002_system_prompt.ipynb`](00-prerequisites/002_system_prompt.ipynb) - where the system prompt goes and what it changes.
- [`00-prerequisites/003_temperature.ipynb`](00-prerequisites/003_temperature.ipynb) - what temperature actually does to output.
- [`00-prerequisites/004_streaming.ipynb`](00-prerequisites/004_streaming.ipynb) - streaming responses token by token.
- [`00-prerequisites/005_controlling_output.ipynb`](00-prerequisites/005_controlling_output.ipynb) - `max_tokens`, `stop_sequences`, and prefill as output controls.
- [`00-prerequisites/multi_turn_conversation.ipynb`](00-prerequisites/multi_turn_conversation.ipynb) - history management, which is the loop's other half.

Three of these ship an `_exercise` variant if you want to type it yourself: `001_requests_exercise.ipynb`, `002_system_prompt_exercise.ipynb`, `005_controlling_output_exercise.ipynb`. There's also a one-cell [`first_request.ipynb`](00-prerequisites/first_request.ipynb) if you just want to prove your key works.

### Deeper on this segment

- [`../docs/domain-1-agentic.md`](../docs/domain-1-agentic.md) - the full Domain 1 reference, roughly ten times what fit in 50 minutes.
- [`../hooks-example.py`](../hooks-example.py) - a real **PreToolUse** / **PostToolUse** pair, not a sketch.
- [`../coordinator-subagent-sketch.py`](../coordinator-subagent-sketch.py) - a 40-line conceptual scaffold of the topology you just ran.

### The managed-agents counterpart

Same architecture, except **Anthropic hosts the loop**. You define the agent and the tools, and the platform runs the `stop_reason` state machine you hand-wrote above.

- [`06-managed-agents/01_agentic_loop_and_sessions.ipynb`](06-managed-agents/01_agentic_loop_and_sessions.ipynb) - the managed version of this segment's loop, plus real sessions.
- [`06-managed-agents/02_coordinator_and_subagents.ipynb`](06-managed-agents/02_coordinator_and_subagents.ipynb) - the managed version of the coordinator-subagent demo.

### Cookbook anchors (Anthropic official)

- [`../claude-cookbooks-main/tool_use/customer_service_agent.ipynb`](../claude-cookbooks-main/tool_use/customer_service_agent.ipynb) - Anthropic's own take on the agent we built.
- [`../claude-cookbooks-main/claude_agent_sdk/01_The_chief_of_staff_agent.ipynb`](../claude-cookbooks-main/claude_agent_sdk/01_The_chief_of_staff_agent.ipynb) - the **Agent SDK** `Task` primitive, which is the production wrapper for our coordinator.
- [`../claude-cookbooks-main/patterns/agents/orchestrator_workers.ipynb`](../claude-cookbooks-main/patterns/agents/orchestrator_workers.ipynb) - the orchestrator-workers pattern in its canonical form.

### Keep going

- [`./segment-2-5-control-surfaces.ipynb`](./segment-2-5-control-surfaces.ipynb) - the self-study deep dive on `tool_choice`, `stop_sequences`, and the Console asset surface. It isn't on the class clock.
- [`../docs/EXAM-STUDY-PATH.md`](../docs/EXAM-STUDY-PATH.md) - the map from these notebooks to the CCA-F domains, if you're sitting the exam.
