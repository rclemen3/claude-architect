# Segment 4: CCA-F Certification Capstone

**Duration:** 50 minutes (12 min briefing + 28 min weighted practice + 10 min Q&A and close)
**Maps to:** All five CCA-F domains
**References:** [`../docs/CERT-PROGRAM-BRIEFING.md`](../docs/CERT-PROGRAM-BRIEFING.md), [`../docs/PRACTICE-QUESTIONS.md`](../docs/PRACTICE-QUESTIONS.md)

You have the skills. The **exam** is how you signal them. This is the **CCA-F debrief**: mechanics, weights, and a weighted practice run so you leave knowing your weakest domain.

## Learning objectives

- Name the **CCA-F exam mechanics** (60 questions, 120 minutes, $99, one attempt, 720 passing)
- Recall the **five domain weights** and which two account for 38% of the score
- Identify your **weakest domain** from the live practice questions

## What CCA-F is

**Claude Certified Architect, Foundations** is Anthropic's first official certification, aimed at architects already shipping with the **Agent SDK**, **Claude Code**, the **Claude API**, and **MCP**. Call it the **301 level**: past "hello world", short of distillation pipelines.

It's a **beta product**, so Anthropic reserves the right to retire and refresh it. Watch the official cert page.

## How the ten questions are weighted

We sample **by domain weight, not by scenario**, because two of the four scenarios skew heavily **D3**. Sampling uniformly across scenarios would over-test Claude Code and under-test everything else.

|---|---:|---:|---|
| **D1** Agentic Architecture | 27% | **3** | Coordinator-subagent, stop_reason branching, agent loops |
| **D2** Tool Design + MCP | 18% | **2** | Tool descriptions, structured errors, MCP discovery |
| **D3** Claude Code | 20% | **2** | CLAUDE.md hierarchy, skills, headless mode |
| **D4** Prompts + Structured Output | 20% | **2** | Forced tool_choice, few-shot, prompt engineering |

1. **This week:** wire one of today's agents into a real workflow. Don't let demo code rot in a notebook.

3. **Toward the exam:** work [`../docs/CERT-PROGRAM-BRIEFING.md`](../docs/CERT-PROGRAM-BRIEFING.md), score **>900** on the Anthropic Practice Exam, then schedule. **One attempt only.**
4. **Calibration:** self-assess with [`../docs/PRACTICE-QUESTIONS.md`](../docs/PRACTICE-QUESTIONS.md).

## Going further: your post-class study kit

Four hours buys you the skills. This repo is what you take home. Everything below is already on your disk.

### Study the exam

- [**`../docs/CERT-PROGRAM-BRIEFING.md`**](../docs/CERT-PROGRAM-BRIEFING.md) covers exam mechanics, domain weights, and the full week-before punchlist, all of it public-sourced.
- [**`../docs/EXAM-STUDY-PATH.md`**](../docs/EXAM-STUDY-PATH.md) maps a study route through the repo if you want someone else's ordering.
- [**`../docs/PRACTICE-QUESTIONS.md`**](../docs/PRACTICE-QUESTIONS.md) is the 60-question take-home, with per-distractor rationale and Anthropic doc citations. [`../practice-questions.json`](../practice-questions.json) is the machine-readable source this notebook sampled ten from. These questions are **community-sourced calibration**, not predictors, and I don't have insider knowledge of the item bank.

### The two off-clock notebooks

- [**`./cca-f-exam-mastery.ipynb`**](./cca-f-exam-mastery.ipynb) is the **most exam-aligned artifact in this repo** and we never touched it live. Seven parts, one per domain plus a mechanics part, mapping **every task statement from TS1.1 through TS5.6** to a runnable minimal demo. If you only open one file after today, open this one.
- [**`./segment-2-5-control-surfaces.ipynb`**](./segment-2-5-control-surfaces.ipynb) is the self-study deep dive: all four `tool_choice` modes, `disable_parallel_tool_use`, `stop_sequences` and `max_tokens` as control levers, MCP `list_tools` discovery, and the Claude Console asset surface (memory stores, vaults, agents, sessions).

### The five domain references

One file per exam domain, each a ~1000-word reference with cookbook anchors and production tips: [`domain-1-agentic.md`](../docs/domain-1-agentic.md), [`domain-2-tools-mcp.md`](../docs/domain-2-tools-mcp.md), [`domain-3-claude-code.md`](../docs/domain-3-claude-code.md), [`domain-4-prompts.md`](../docs/domain-4-prompts.md), [`domain-5-context.md`](../docs/domain-5-context.md).

### Keep building

- [**`00-prerequisites/`**](00-prerequisites/) holds ten Messages API primer notebooks, `001_requests` through `005_controlling_output` plus exercises. Start here if the raw API still feels shaky.
- [**`06-managed-agents/`**](06-managed-agents/) holds six Managed Agents notebooks, domain-banded 01 through 06 and ending in `06_cca_f_capstone.ipynb`. This is the "Anthropic hosts the loop" counterpart to the loops you hand-rolled today.
- [**`../examples/mcp_cli/`**](../examples/mcp_cli/) is the vendored reference MCP CLI app from Segment 2.
- [**`../claude-cookbooks-main/`**](../claude-cookbooks-main/) is Anthropic's official cookbook, vendored under MIT. [`../docs/COOKBOOK-INDEX.md`](../docs/COOKBOOK-INDEX.md) tells you which cookbook backs which segment.

### Course scaffolding

[`../COURSE-FLOW.md`](../COURSE-FLOW.md) is the full instructor punchlist for all four segments. [`../hooks-example.py`](../hooks-example.py) and [`../coordinator-subagent-sketch.py`](../coordinator-subagent-sketch.py) are the reference implementations behind Segment 1. [`../docs/scenario-cicd-integration.md`](../docs/scenario-cicd-integration.md) walks a CI/CD scenario end to end.
